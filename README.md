Random things!
==============

This is a repository for any small, interesting scripts cooked up over the years in the metaphorical margins of classtime and in between homework assignments.

### Drawing ###
_Located in `drawing`_
A series of Java classes to draw various shapes. Of mild interest is DottedLine.java.

### Problem sets ###
_Located in `problem-sets`_
Solved problem sets from NCSSM's AP Computer Science A (I) in Python. Not easy to read - this was before I understood the importance of comments and documentation!

### MergeSort and BubbleSort ###
_See `Sort.java`_
Java implementations of merge sort and bubble sort. Written for Data Structures I.

### Bump! ###
_See `bump.html`_
The result of a spontaneous code-off on a Facebook event page. A surprisingly small, simple way to animate things with CSS and JavaScript.

### One-line recursion problem set ###
_See `one-line.py`_
8 recursion problems implemented and solved in one line. Ugly, unreadable, and cryptic, but mildly interesting.

### Numerical methods for ODEs ###
_See `solver.py`_
3 numerical methods for approximating ordinary differential equations written in Python: linear Euler's method, quadratic Euler's method, and Runge-Kutta order 4 method. Written in conjunction with Bradley King.
